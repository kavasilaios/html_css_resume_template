					<h2>Enterprise IT Systems Administrator/Devops Engineer</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">June 2019 - Present</p>
					<p>•	Configured a monitoring infrastructure consisting of Prometheus, Loki as data sources and Grafana as a visualization app. I have created and continue to update various dashboards to provide up to date information on ssl certificates expiration, performance metrics, log aggregation on several applications and also utilized the alertmanager addon to create custom alert rules in order to get instantly notified of infrastructure component issues.
•	IIS Server configuration according to each application’s requirements, also hardened IIS according to security’s best practices to disable weak protocols, ciphers and cipher suites.
•	Management of public Certificates (on IIS or Nginx).
•	Setup from scratch the SharePoint 2016 farm architecture and facilitated all system and application level configurations to assist with a SharePoint 2010 to 2016 migration. At the same time I provide a 2nd level of support on the SharePoint application to determine route cause of issues and point to the proper solution.
•	Configured RabbitMQ over TLS in order to create a secure message queuing environment for incoming messages for a custom .NET core application using MongoDB as document database for the event logs of the application.
•	Support Kentico CMS and custom .NET applications to run smoothly in a web farm environment.
•	SQL admin on all the enterprise applications (custom .NET apps, Kentico CMS, SharePoint). I also setup and maintain Always On availability groups to minimize app downtime. 
•	I drove the initiative to switch from Microsoft TFS to GitLab as a code Repository and started using GitLab CI to shift the whole team’s focus to DevOps, by creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines that made the build, testing and deployment of apps more automated and efficient.
•	Also, in parallel used Azure DevOps to take advantage of the seamless integration with on-premises deployments on IIS
•	Utilized Azure Logic Apps to create Workflows that integrate with internal systems (SharePoint, SQL Server, SAP PI) to improve business practices.
